- 👋 Hi, I’m @liberlander22

- I am NOT a programmer :::gasp:::
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about blockchain in general terms and how Liberland hopes to implement it.
- 
- I'm a noob Linux user. Got into it summer of 2021, learned some command line stuff, and mostly forgot it by now. Life is busy, and I am not a programmer. 
- I am also brand spankin new to Github.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing out the Liberland Validator Node on Menger Testnet.

- I'm an ELECTRICAL engineer by trade (no, not computers, not electronics), but am a building manager these days.
